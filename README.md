MNIST Image Classification
This project involves classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset includes 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels), split into training (60,000) and testing (10,000) sets.

We implemented models multilayer perceptrons (MLP), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN achieved ~97% accuracy, outperforming simpler models.

Key steps include data preprocessing (normalization), training with the Adam optimizer, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices.

To run the project, install dependencies and execute train.py. Contributions are welcome under the MIT license.
